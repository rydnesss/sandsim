#**ABOUT**:

This is a simple sand simulation game which has five particles: sand, water, wood, smoke, fire.
It relies on cellular automata (the principle behind conway's game of life) and sees particles act intrinsically and interact with one another within a certain range (splash.)
It's not without its issues and there's some sloppy code here and there.

#**USAGE**: 

To switch between particles, use the keyboard buttons 1-5.
To increase or decrease particle size, use the upwards and downwards arrow keys.
To place particles, hold the left mouse button.
To delete particles, hold the right mouse button.
